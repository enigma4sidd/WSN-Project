## Summary

Employed temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity sensors to predict onset of diseases in crops so that the farmer could spray pesticides only when prompted to via email notifications, resulting in tremendous cost savings. The sensor data is presented in a graphical view to the farmers either on web or an Android app. 

This web application is developed as part of a course project in Dr. Janise McNair's, Wireless Adhoc Networks course at the University of Florida, in Nov' 2017.
